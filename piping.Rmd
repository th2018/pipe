Pipes are a powerful tool for clearly expressing a sequence of multiple operations. 

Stacking functions inside of each other can create code that is difficult to read. 

```{r}
#create a vector
v1<-c(12.3,4.32)
print(v1)
```

Method 1
```{r}
m1<-mean(v1)
print(m1)

r1<-round(m1)
print(r1)
```

Method 2
```{r}
r1<-round(mean(v1))
print(r1)
```

Method 3
```{r}
v1 %>% mean() %>% round()
```
